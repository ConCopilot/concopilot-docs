# The `run` API

This is a lower level API (comparing to the `conpack`) to build a component and run a copilot.

This API does not initialize the running environment (the `conpack` settings),
thus we do NOT recommend to use this API unless you know what you are doing.

Please check the [source code](https://github.com/ConCopilot/concopilot/blob/main/concopilot/framework/run.py) for details.
